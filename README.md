 Introduction

 
In today’s fast-paced and mobile-dependent world, ensuring personal safety during emergencies has become a critical concern. Situations such as unexpected delays, unsafe locations, health emergencies, or environmental risks often require immediate communication and quick assistance. Traditional methods like phone calls or manual messaging may not always be effective during such critical moments due to panic, physical limitations, or network constraints.
The Intelligent Emergency Alert & Response System is a mobile-based application designed to provide instant emergency communication, real-time location tracking, and intelligent monitoring to ensure timely assistance. The system enables users to send SOS alerts with live GPS location to registered guardians and trusted contacts, allowing them to respond quickly and effectively. Continuous tracking and automated alerts reduce dependence on manual intervention and improve response reliability.
The application incorporates intelligent features such as journey monitoring, geo-fence alerts, activity monitoring, and weather-based risk notifications to provide preventive safety support. By leveraging data analytics and artificial intelligence techniques, the system identifies abnormal movement patterns, delayed journeys, and potential risk conditions, enabling proactive alerts before situations escalate into emergencies.
By integrating real-time communication, intelligent decision-making, and community-based support, the proposed system aims to enhance personal safety, improve emergency response efficiency, and offer a reliable technological solution for handling critical situations in everyday life.
